title: Testing multi-container applications with Docker Compose and Semaphore
category: Docker
---

Docker Compose is right at home in a continuous integration environment, given its
ability to easily bootstrap your containers and their interconnectedness for
testing and development purposes. This page will guide you through setting up
and testing a simple multi-container project on Semaphore.

After signing up for a Semaphore account, you're ready to add your first project.
To follow along, you can fork the [GitHub repository])() used in this guide.
As the repository is open-source, clicking on "Build Public Project" will pull
a list of public projects from your connected repository host account, in this case,
from GitHub.

Choosing the repository will fetch it's branches and show you the branch
selection page. This is where we choose the branch for our initial build. Other,
pre-existing branches, can be added later on and new branches will be added
automatically by Semaphore.

A brief analysis will gather some information about your repository and show
you the platform selection screen. If the repository has a `Dockerfile` or
`docker-compose.yml`, the Docker-enabled platform will be pre-selected.

On the next screen, you can optionally configure your container registry
credentials for accessing your private Docker images.

Next, Semaphore will suggest some build commands. If you need to, you can tailer
them to your needs with the commands editor, or later in Project Settings.

Clicking "Build" will kick-off your first build. Sit back, and let Semaphore do
all the work. After a short while, you will be greeted with a successful build.

Testing images is great, but at some point, you will want to push them to your
container registry. To see how it's done, check out [our guides about deploying
images to the clouds](nd-cr-deployments).

Happy building!
