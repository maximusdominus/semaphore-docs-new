title: Setting up a continuous integration for a Docker project on Semaphore
category: Docker
---

Setting up continuous integration for your **Docker** project and running your
first build on Semaphore is easy and intuitive. Semaphore supports GitHub and
Bitbucket which makes importing your code and building it even easier.

If you don't already have a Semaphore account, you can [sign up](/users/sign_up).
After confirming your email address. The free account gives you **unlimited**
CI service for open-source projects and up to 100 private builds per month.

After you have signed in on Semaphore for the first time, a welcome screen will
prompt you to add your first project. Click "Build a new Project" button to get
started.

If you already have some projects on Semaphore, you can easily add a new
project by clicking "Add new project" button.

If the next step prompts you to connect your Semaphore account with your
GitHub/Bitbucker account, please consult the
[Adding your GitHub or Bitbucket project to Semaphore](/docs/adding-github-bitbucket-project-to-semaphore.html)
page in our documentation which explains it in details.

After you have connected your version control account with your Semaphore
account, Semaphore will list all the projects you can add. You can select one
from the list.

Next, select a branch you would like to build. Semaphore will **automatically**
test every new branch you create, and remove the ones you delete from origin.
Additional preexisting branches can be easily added from your project page
later on.

After that, Semaphore will perform a **quick analysis** of the source code and
it will recognize presence of your `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml`. This
will generate a set of working build commands depending on your project's
programming language which you will see later on.

Next, Semaphore will prompt you to choose a platform for you project based on
the project analysis. If you have `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` in your
project, Semaphore will preselect the platform with Docker support enabled.
Click on "Docker" option. You can change the platform later on the project's
settings page.

###### "Docker platform" sceenshot

Once you have chosen a platform, you can add your container registry host.
We support:

 - Docker Hub,
 - Amazon EC2 Container Registry (ECR),
 - Google Container Registry (GCR),
 - Quay.io,
 - Custom container registries.

This step is optional, so if you don't use any of the above, you can click
"Skip this step".

If your project needs to run commands that are different from what Semaphore has
suggested, just use the commands editor to customize them for your needs.

At this point, you'll be ready to launch your first **Docker** build. Click on
"Build With These Settings" to do so. If all goes well, you should see your
first successful build on Semaphore.

Happy building!
