category: The Semaphore platform
---

Semaphore currently offers [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) support in a beta
platform. If you want to use this platform for your projects, you can switch to
it in `Project Settings > Platform`.

The beta platform has Docker <%= package_version("docker") %> and [docker-machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/)
 <%= package_version("docker-machine") %> pre-installed, so once you make the switch,
you're ready to use the Docker [CLI](https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/)
in your build commands.

To avoid permission problems when using the Docker CLI, commands should be used
with `sudo`.
